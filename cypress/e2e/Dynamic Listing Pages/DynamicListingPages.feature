Feature: Dynamic Listing Pages

    Scenario Outline: All dynamic trial listing pages components are displayed(with pagers) on results view for all routes
        Given screen breakpoint is set to "<screen breakpoint>"
        When user is navigating to "<path>"
        Then page title is "<page title>"
        And intro text 1 paragraph is "<firstParagraph>"
        And intro text 2 paragraph is "NCIâ€™s basic information about clinical trials explains the types and phases of trials and how they are carried out. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. You may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Talk to your doctor for help in deciding if one is right for you."
        And "basic information about clinical trials" link has href "/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/what-are-trials"
        And the page displays pager info "Trials 1-N of N"
        And the page "1" is highlighted
        And each result displays the trial title with a link in the following format "/clinicaltrials/NCI-"
        And each result displays the trial summary
        And each result displays "Location: " below the summary
        And delighter is displayed with link "/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search"
